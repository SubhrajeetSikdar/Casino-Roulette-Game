# Roulette Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Roulette game in C. The game allows players to place bets on Red, Black, or Green numbers and then guess the outcome. If the guess matches the result, the player wins; otherwise, they lose.

2. Place your bet by entering `1` for Red, `2` for Black, or `3` for Green.

4. The game will randomly select a number between `0` and `36`.
5. If your guess matches the result, you win; otherwise, you lose.
6. Choose to play again or exit the game.
